Photic stimulation was performed at the frequencies of 1-21 Hz.  Symmetrical photoentrainment was seen. Hyperventilation procedure produced posterior dominant generalized build-up. In stage I sleep, vertex waves were seen. In stage II sleep, sleep spindles and K complexes were noted. During slow wave sleep, diffusely distributed higher amplitude delta frequency activity was seen. During hyperventilation 5 clinical seizures ranging from 12 to 21 seconds in durations with semiology of cessation of hyperventilation, staring, looking to left, eye blinking, rubbing face/nose and mouth automatisms, with EEG showing 2.5- 3 Hz frontal dominant generalized spike and wave discharges with sometimes not clear onset and not clear offset, instead showing slowing, were recorded.  During drowse/sleep 3 additional seizures lasting from 5-16 seconds were captured.
